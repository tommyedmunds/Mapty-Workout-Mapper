# Mapty-Workout-Mapper
  An application that makes logging workouts easy based on the user's geolocation. This project is my first foray into object oriented programming concepts within the JavaScript language. Additionally, the project utilizes the Javascript Geolocator API and basic asynchronous JavaScript functions.
CSS, HTML, and the photo assets were written/created by Jonas Schmedtmann as part of the "Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert".
